# ElephantBook_FieldGuide

USAGE:

Upon first opening the app, you should see a list of elephants. Choosing one of the elephants will give you a screen with an elephant name, their SEEK code, a picture of the elephant, and a map of recent sitings.

CONTRIBUTION GUIDLINES:

Like every other project in GitHub, the preffered method of contributing is to fork the Repo and make changes in YourUsername/ElephantBook_FieldGuide.
If you have an old version of the ElephantBook_FieldGuide, GitHub will recognise that you are using a forked version and will give you the option to fetch upstream.
Once changes have been made, you can then open a pull request to have your changes added to the main repo.
